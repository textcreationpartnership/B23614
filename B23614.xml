            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Christian READER.</head>
            <p>BEing truly sensible, how easily we forget our selves in time of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Sickness, and that <hi>to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer like a Christian,</hi> is one of the most difficult Tasks, that belongs to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; I have therefore concluded, that a little Help will not at all be unwelcome to any under these Trials; and for that end, have made a short Collection of some Instructions and Devotions, which I hope, may be serviceable for the keeping up the Spirit of Christianity, under these Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. The Holy Scriptures have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished a great part of the Matter for this little Work; and besides this, I have made use of the <hi>Following of Christ. Card. Bona, Alphonsus Rodericus, Paradisus animae, Arsdekin,</hi> &amp;c. all most approv'd Authors, who have writ on this Subject. If it contributes any thing to the relief of
<pb facs="tcp:206808:5"/> my Neighbour in his Distresses, 'tis a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I owe him, and will be no less a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to me than to him. If it helps him to prepare for a good End, 'tis what I wish him with all my Soul, having recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing to him, but as I desire for my self; and so may I be found at my last Hour.</p>
            <p>I am sensible, the help I here offer him, is not such as I could desire, and for this reason, it has been laid by for some Years, in expectation of something more compleat appearing from a better Hand; but since nothing comes forth to answer my Desires, and something seems wanting, I now Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish this, being perswaded, that such as are in Distress, will be contented with this help, till they are provided with better.</p>

            <head>INSTRUCTIONS AND DEVOTIONS FOR THE Afflicted, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> WHat is a Christian to do, in time of <hi>Sadness</hi> and <hi>Afflicton?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He ought to have recourse to God, and seek Comfort in him. For that being a time of <hi>Trial,</hi> what should he do, but beg for Strength from above, that so being call'd forth into the Field of Battle, he may not fall in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Tis God has promis'd to be the Comforter of the Afflicted, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the Widow, of the Orphan and the Distress'd: And where should
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:206808:6"/> a Christian in these streights, turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but to him, who is the Fountain of all Mercy and Comfort? This is the Command God has given him by the Prophet <hi>David, Ps.</hi> 49. 18. <hi>Call upon me,</hi> says the Almighty, <hi>in the day of Tribulation, and I will deliver thee.</hi> And the good effect of this Expedient, the same Royal Prophet experienc'd; when having in these words laid open the excess of Grief, that then oppress'd his Mind, <hi>Renuit consolari anima mea. My Soul was so dejected, that it refus'd all Comfort.</hi> He presently sets down the Cure; <hi>Memor fui Dei &amp; delectatus sum. I cast my thoughts on God, and presently I was fill'd with Joy.</hi> Excessive Grief was his Distemper, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, was in raising his Heart to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> No Christian can doubt, but God is the most certain relief of an afflicted Spirit; but there's a great difficulty for a Soul, in time of Trouble and Sadness, to raise it self truly to God; because, at that time, 'tis depress'd and kept down under a certain weight, that weakens the Spirits, and leaves it almost without Life: 'Tis then in darkness; and such a black Cloud generally hangs over it, that God
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:206808:6"/> is not then in its sight: And how shall he then raise himself to his Lord for comfort; when the very trouble, that puts him into the necessity of seeking it, quite indisposes him for the doing it, leaving him without Life, Motion and Sight?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis true, the Soul, in those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, is something indispos'd, and through the corruption of Nature, more inclin'd to lye down under the weight it feels, than raise it self up and seek for relief. But this is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness a Christian by no means ought to yield to, but instead of this, chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to use violence with himself, and force <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Inclination</hi> to yield to <hi>Duty:</hi> He is then to summon up all the Courage he has, quicken his sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits, and make head against the Enemy, who is then throwing him into Darkness and Chains. Such sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable endeavours as these, will make an entire change in the Soul; so that whereas it seem'd wholly indispos'd, through disquiet and trouble, for the seeking its God, it shall now, being thus excited, run to him with greater life, and pour forth it self into Prayers with more than ordinary fervor.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:206808:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I could gladly be inform'd, how this might be; since meeting with Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Crosses and Disquiets so often, 'twold be some satisfaction, did I but know how to make them turn to so good account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There are few but know how to do it, but are unwilling to take the pains: It cannot be done without some struggling and resisting the bent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and this being difficult in that State, when the spirits are weakned and cast down, few have courage to attempt it; and so neglect to make use of those means, which otherwise they well know, would be beneficial to them. For this reason, a good Friend is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry necessary at that time, who, by laying before them the true Motives of Christian Peace, Patience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, may help to give them new life, and encourage them to go on in their Duty. But because such a Help cannot be so often at hand, as our frequent Troubles and Disturbances of Mind require; therefore it is very fit, every Christian should be provided with some Book, which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in these Circumstances, to suggest to him such good thoughts, as may contribute to his Peace and help at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:206808:7"/> least to abate the Storm. A little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is very serviceable in this case, and a good preparative to dispose the heart for Prayer. And because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thig can be more effectual, than to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Nature of Tribulation, and the Reasons, why God is pleas'd to visit us with Afflictions, I'll here, in the first place, lay these before you, and then furnish you with some short Lessons out of the best Authors on this Subject, and Prayers, which you may make use of according as you find them to your purpose. And this method, I hope you'll find to be some relief in your Troubles.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Tribulation, and the reason why God permits it.</head>
               <p>TO lay a good foundation in this affair, every Christian ought to imprint well in his mind, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on these great Truths, which Faith teaches us: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That as God has created all things, so he at all times, and even at present, ordains, appoints and governs all. 2. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happens, whether little or great, prosperous or afflicting, without his Providence. 3. That in whatever
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206808:8"/> comes to pass, in the whole World, he exercises either his Justice or his Mercy. 4. That no Creature has any power, but what comes from him; so that they are all to be look'd on, as the Instruments or Ministers of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, being, according to the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Scripture, as <hi>The Ax in the hand of him that cuts, or as a Staff of him that strikes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The due consideration of these truths by Christians, will lay a good ground for their receiving all troubles with a peaceable and resigned mind. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving consider'd God as the Soveraign Lord and Governor of all, and his Will as the Supreme Justice, they will hence conclude; that it is fit he should Reign, and we obey; That it is his part to appoint, direct and guide, and ours to follow; That we ought in all things to conform our selves to his Will, and not expect, that he should submit to ours; That his Will being always Just, always Holy, it is also always adorable, always worthy of our Submission and Love, however the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof prove harsh and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some: For that only such Souls as are unjust, can find fault with what Justice
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:206808:8"/> it self does; whilst the Pious and Good, under all Extremities, and amidst all the repugnancies of Nature, ever cry out with the Prophet: <hi>Nonne Deo sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a erit anima? My Soul, wilt thou not submit thy self to God?</hi> To whom art thou to be subject but to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> This consideration of the Will of God acting in every Creature, will put Christians upon looking beyond Creatures in all their disappointments and cross events of things; 'twill make them take notice, not only of the Rod, that strikes and chastises, but more particularly have regard to the Hand that manages, and the Will that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects it; and this will be a great step in order to a lasting inward Peace. For if Christians discern'd God every where, and look'd on him through all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; if they saw, it is he gives them all the force they have, that it is he who pushes them forward, to put in execution his eternal Decrees; the the sight of this Justice and Power would give a cheek to all their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, their Murmurings and Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. For which of them, in his Presence, dares say, They deserve not what they suffer? Who could
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206808:9"/> have any other sentiments, than those which made Holy <hi>David</hi> say, <hi>Obmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui &amp; humiliatus sum, quoniam tu fecisti, I held my peace, and was humbled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was thou, Lord, that didst this.</hi> There's nothing of all that happens to us, but what our Lord does, and who can say, It is not well? We may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selves under his Scourge; but if we complain, what is this, but for Dust and Ashes, to set it self up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Almighty, and question, if not strive, to reverse his Decrees?</p>
               <p>Thus, if we kept our Eyes ever fix'd on this first Cause of all Events, how would this help to moderate and compose all disquiets of our minds; how should we then see in all Evils, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes and injustices, the just chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mens Sins: That all is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and holy, both in regard of God ordaining all things, and in respect of Men, on whom his Decrees are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; so that tho the Ministers of this over-ruling Will, through their own depravedness, may be guilty of Injustice; yet their Injustice hinders not what they do; from providing just and equitable to those that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it?</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:206808:9"/>
               <p>In this manner, the discovering the Finger of God's Justice touching us in every Trouble, may be as a lenitive to take off the Sharpness of such Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as in those circumstances, are too apt to affect and disquiet the mind. For though Nature be then so uneasie, as to be inclin'd to rebell, yet upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerning the <hi>Will of God</hi> and his <hi>Justice,</hi> even in the severest Trials, must it not then necessarily be over-aw'd by that Sovereign Power, and force it self to a compliance with those Orders, which cannot be controll'd; and where it falls into murmurings, impatience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, it soon experiences, that all this is only adding to that Burthen, which is already its aggrievance, but can be no remedy at all of the Evil?</p>
               <p>It may be a farther relief, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on some other reasons, why God is pleas'd to visit us with Afflictions. As first, that by these bitter Potions, we may be wean'd from the things of this World, that our affections may be taken off from these fading Objects, and fix'd on a more lasting Good; that we may be contented, if not Desire, to be dissolv'd, and releas'd from this Banishment and vale of Tears. This
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:206808:10"/> was the Blessing accompanied that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere oppression of the Israelites in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> who being tired and quite b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>n with their slavery, began to cry aloud to God, and desire to be set at liberty, and were thus prepar'd for the Land of Promise. How much do we stand in need of Burthens, that we may be thus tired with our slavery! The World, says St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> Bitter and uneasie as it is, is yet lov'd; what would it then be, did all things ever succeed to our wish? If thus we gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily catch at and embrace its Thorns, what should we do, did it every where abound with Flowers? May not there then be very great Blessings thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to us, under what we often complain of, as our greatest Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; while we are thus brought to be disgusted with the World, and made more willing to leave it: Of which God knows, how viciously fond we might be, how our heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be wholly possess'd with it, did every thing prove favourable in it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> If we consider, that Afflictions are an Exercise, by which God trys the Just, and makes proof of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. 'Tis an easie thing, in words,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:206808:10"/> to make profession of serving and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God; but the Sincerity of this Profession then appears, when Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Tribulation begin to make their assaults; then it is the faithful Servant is discover'd, when he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues stedfast under his Trial, when he stands firm and unmov'd, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Disquiets and Opposition, and lets nothing, however troublesome, force him from his Duty, or, in the least, divide him from his Lord. For as Gold is try'd in the Fire, so are the Just try'd in Afflictions. This it was the Angel taught <hi>Toby:</hi> Because thou wast acceptable to God; says he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was necessary he should make proof of thy Fidelity. This was the reason why this holy Man was visited with Blindness. And under this Tryal may Christians esteem themselvrs, as often as they perceive tribulations to arise against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> We reflect, That <hi>the Rod and Correction give Wisdom.</hi> that these are often the Means, by which God opens the Eyes of Blind and perverse Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, softens the Obstinate, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the stupid and Dull: 'Twas by this expedient <hi>Nebuchednesor</hi> came to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:206808:11"/> the knowledge of the ever living God; 'twas by the same the <hi>Prodigal Son</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came sensible of his misery, and first thought of returning to his Father. How many sinners have been reclaim'd by this way; and how many are now Saints in Heaven, who must confess, Sickness, Poverty or Affliction to have been the happy occasion of their tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Eyes that way; and that, had they not been thus awak'ned, they might have for ever slept on in Death!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> If we observe, that suffering Troubles with Patience, is a most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means for obtaining pardon of Sin. <hi>For God is full of Compassion and Mercy, and in the day of Tribulation he will forgive our Offences.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> being conscious of his Guilt, and knowing, how beneficial Affliction might be to him, in order to the making his peace with God, and being discharg'd from his Sin, openly made this profession: <hi>Ego ad flagella paratus sum.</hi> I am waiting for Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; I am prepared for the Scourge; I know I have Offended, and am sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the Chastisements of God, are the most effectual means for restoring me to his Favour. What Christian is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:206808:11"/> there, that lies not under the guilt of some sin; and if he any ways conceives how in urious this is to his Soul, ought not he ever be prepar'd, with <hi>David,</hi> for the Scourge; willingly accept of all Trouble, as the remedy of his Evil; and never complain of the cruelty of the Surgeon's hand, who Cuts, that he may Cure, and thus strives to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Patient's greater Misery, and hinder his perishing under the filth of his Sores</p>
               <p>With these, and such other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ought every Christian be well furnish'd, by the daily reading of good Books, that so they may be ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for making a good use of all. Troubles, and turning them to the best advantage. How great a help would it be to us, if in all Disappointments, Injustices and Afflictions, we could ever behold the Severaign <hi>Will of God,</hi> and the decrees of his <hi>Justice?</hi> Who would not then strive to make Nature stoop, to his Orders, and go on, without complaint, in that way, where he leads? And if we could ever bear in mind, that the evils we suffer, are to preserve us from the snares of this World, for the encrease of our Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:206808:12"/> and Humility, for the trial of our Fidelity, to make us sensible of our weakness, understand our selves, and to deliver us from those Sins which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might be our eternal ruin; how should we preserve a cheerful Heart under all Sufferings, and from the prospect of so manifold a good, ever bear up under all Trials with courage and comfort? We are us'd to submit to many little Inconveniencies, when these are the price of a more valuable Good; and should not we then labour to arrive to that Christian temper, as to esteem all the Afflictions of this World, but as little inconveniencies, when beholding <hi>Eternal Misery</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> before us, we see these may be a means to rescue us from the one, and purchase the other? If we were so placed, as to have Hell-flames just behind us, and before us all those Troubles we now meet and complain of as grievous, how cheerfully should we run through all these, so to be at a greater distance from that devouring Fire, and secure us against its more important Terrors? If we had a more lively and constant apprehension of this place of Torments, our greatest Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:206808:12"/> we suffer here, would appear as nothing: Then should we esteem the Terms very easie and comfortable, if for the patient undergoing these our short-liv'd and passing Trials, we were to escape those, which are to endure for ever; especially too, if the goin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven be added to the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; how should we then be more easie and contented under all Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, submit to them with a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Will, and never permit our selves to be dejected and sink down as under a Burthen, or give way to melancholy and Sadness, but ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve an even and easie mind, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the great Duty of a Christian, from the assured hopes of the good effect of such Trials, and the happy fruit to be expected from them?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> I'll tell you; I don't expect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity should destroy Nature, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:206808:13"/> moderate and govern it and by holding the Reins, prevent its running into Excesses, to which it violently bends. A tender Mother must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to mourn and shed some Tears at the Death of her Children; and as the stoutest Man must be allow'd to be discompos'd and cry out at any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and sudden Blow that is given him; so in the best of Christians, there will be some uneasiness, disquiet and grief, at those many Misfortunes and strange Accidents, which often happen in the World: But then his care must be, so prudently to moderate these natural and sudden Passions, as not to let them get possession of his Heart, and seize him with <hi>Sadness</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> that he becomes no longer Master of him: For tho moderate Grief be natural and rational, yet the excess of it is vicious and by no means warrantable on any score, in a good Christian; but to be avoided as a most dangerous Evil.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why is</hi> Sadness <hi>and</hi> excessive Grief, <hi>so dangerous?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because, when it comes to that degree, it is like other violent and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Passions, usurps upon Reason and Religion, takes the command out of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:206808:13"/> their hands, and keeps a Man in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uneasie Slavery. 2. Because it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much indisposes a Christian, renders him unfit for every Duty, makes him nauceate his Prayers, so that he either says them without relish, often leaves them unfinish'd, or quite lays them by: And for other Exercies and obligations, how many delays and put-offs? <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micavit anima mea prae taedio. His Soul is drowsie and asleep, thinks but little and do's nothing;</hi> so that there's a kind of a stop put to the whole affair of his Soul. 3. Because it reposes him to evident shares of the Enemy, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangerous Temptations, and often draws him into Sin; so that, it may be, there's no other indisposition of the Soul so serviceable to the Divil as this: <hi>Sub umbra dormit;</hi> when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Soul is clouded with this sort of Darkness and confusion, 'tis in this Darkness the Divil makes his nest; so that, while in other Temptations he makes some passes and attemps, and often go's by, here in this he takes up his rest, and pretends to it as a secure Possession. <hi>Sub umbra dormit.</hi> So that if at any time he invites into a Soul seven other Spirits worse than himself,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:206808:14"/> there's danger of its being so here. For as the Psalmist says: <hi>Posuisti tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bras &amp; facta est nox, in ipsa pertransibunt omnes bestiae silve.</hi> When the Night comes on and Darkness covers the Earth, then it is the Serpents and all the wild Beasts forsake their holes and go abroad for Prey: So here, when Grief and Sadness have brought Night upon a Soul and cover'd it with darkness, then the old Serpent with other Fiends come abroad and securely prey upon all that can be found of good in it. Hence it is that a Christian in these circumstances of Grief, is so easily mov'd to Passion, becomes peevish upon every slight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and gives trouble to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. Hence joalousie arises, Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition and Malice: Hence spring many vain and unreasonable Fears; Hence disorder and Confusion; and hence it is, he often acts so contrary to all the Rules of Reason and Discretion, that he seems to make good what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures says: <hi>Non est sensus, ubi est ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritudo;</hi> Where Melancholy and excess of Sadness have got possession, there Reason and Judgment are much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, if not cast out of doors.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:206808:14"/>
               <p>And is it not this temper the Devil makes use of to drive Men into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, filling them with such dismal and terrifying thoughts, that they seem to think themselves excluded from all the Mercies of God, and that, as for them, there's no Hopes of Pardon: <hi>No body is so bad at they,</hi> ever runs in their mind; and beholding no Good in themselves, God's goodness is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hid from their Eyes? But where this game will not take, that he cannot force them to quit their Confidence in God; how do's he then importune them to seek comfort in dangerous Diversions and Delights, and under the pretext of relieving the Spirits, turns their thoughts upon such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which afterwards prove destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to all Goodness, Piety and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity? How many temperate Men have hence run into all manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess? How many into Licentiousness; and thus to cure Melancholy, have by degrees, laid aside both Religion and Reason? In this manner our spiritual Enemy takes advantage of this seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly harmless indisposition of the mind, and from so inconsiderable a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, too often brings Ruin upon the whole.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:206808:15"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If this be the case of Sadness and Melancholy, that it is the Root of so many Evils, 'tis a very dangerous Distemper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. But how shall a Christian secure himself against it, amidst so many Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, which often come to his lot?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Christianity has no other defence against it, besides Prayer and laborious Endeavours, which it prescribes, as proper to be made use of against such an Enemy. And therefore, as often, as any Dispositions or Inclinations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to appear on the mind, as tending towards Sadness, a good Christian ougt presently to be fearful and jealous, as of an approaching Enemy, and so take the alarm, as to excite in it self all possible courage to make head against and totally suppress him, before he gathers strength: He ouhgt then to stand carefull on his guard, and make the same resistance as against the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all Temptations; for tho no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of sin appears, yet there's that which makes way for all sin; for as Christ had his Apostles, whom he sent before, promising he would follow after them: so the Devil has his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, whom he sends to prepaare his way before him; and amongst
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:206808:15"/> these, <hi>Sadness</hi> must have its place, as being but too often his Fore-runner. What then should a Christian do, when it begins to shew It self, but on the one side, stand up in his own defence, labour resist and fight against it, and have recourse to all those Motives, proper for the encouraging him to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Submission, Resignation, look on the end of his Calling, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christianity, the desert of his Sins, the examples of the Saints, and of their Leader, Christ our Lord, the reward of patient Suffering, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Impatience; and on the other side, have recourse to Heaven by Prayer, and by pious reading of good Books, so comfort and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Mind, that however he may have misfortunes enough, to disturb and put him into some disorder for the present, yet that he deliver not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up to dejection and Melancholy, but ever struggle with the evil, and not omit to cast up some thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, even in the greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, till by degrees he so recover the dominion of himself, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Passion, that he readily submit to the Decrees of God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206808:16"/> and with cheerfulness embrace his Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Well, if yielding to Sadness, may not be allow'd to the Ʋnfortunate, may it not be permitted at least to those Pious Christians, who grieve not for this World, but for the next; not for themselves, but for God, whom they earnestly desire to Serve and Love above all things? there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whose business is the Salvation of their Souls, and whose Wishes are to Pray fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to Repent Heartily, to forsake every thing that can possibly render them displeasing to God: And behold, while they are labouring to go on in this Course, they meet with so many Distractions, such frequent Temptations, and so often fall into those Weaknesses and Offences, which they purpos'd to avoid, that all things seem to go backward with them: And how can these choose but lament these their fruitless endeavours, while they see, in striving to come nearer God, they go farther from him? Sure, if they love God, they must needs be troubled at the many hindrances they find in his Service: And if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, certainly it must be allow'd them to grieve for their Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis true, if ever Grief be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a Christian, it must be for Sin:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:206808:16"/> But this grief for Sin, is very different from that <hi>Sadness</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> of which we have hitherto spoke: For while we are commanded to repent of our Sins, and be heartily troubl'd for having offended God; see what kind of Trouble this is: This is a Holy Trouble, a Trouble that is Obedient, Affable, Humble, Meek, accompanied with Sweetness and Patience; a Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which, instead of discouraging the Soul, cheers it up, and incites it seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to apply such remedies as are most effective for the preventing all manner of relapse; that is, spurs it forward to Penance and Prayers, to Vigilancy and Labour. This is the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a Contrite Heart, to which the Holy Scriptures and Church so often invite us; this is the true Christian Mourning, which Christ has promis'd to reward with Bliss. While Sadness and Melanchaly have quite other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; ever rendring the Soul stupid and dull, forward and harsh, taking off all relish from Prayer and other exercises of Penance, disswading her from making use of them, as being likely to have no effect in her, whose evils are not to be remedied. Thus
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:206808:17"/> these betray themselves to be evil Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a distemper'd Mind, and no Vertues, whilst they incline it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the Principles of Reason and Religion, extinguish Hope, and are so injurious to the Goodness of God: And therefore, as often as a Christian observes these motions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, with a sort of Dulness and Dejection stealing on his Spirits, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be pretended for his Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the foulness of his Sins, he ought immediately use endeavours for the shaking it off, give no credit to all the fair colours and pretexts, under which it presents it self, but conclude it to be all Imposture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and tho there be a great trouble and disquiet on the Mind, and all pretended for Sin, yet still to suspect, that 'tis more Indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and Distemper, than true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>For true Repentance takes another way; it first indeed represents the sins of the Penitent, as contrary to God's Goodness, to his Will and express Command; it shews them in God's Justice, to be condemn'd of Insolence, Ingratitude and Injustice: Hence it excites in his heart a Trouble and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:206808:17"/> for his Unworthiness to so Good a God: But then, Secondly, It never fails to point towards the infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Goodness of his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is ever ready to pardon those very Sins, upon his Repenting and Forsaking them; and here, upon this prospect and assurance, flows in a certain Comfort upon the Soul, not removing the Trouble for having Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but so sweeting it, as to inspire the mind with new Life and Courage, and push it forward to a cheerful under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and performance of whatever is proper for making his Peace with God: So that this true Penitential sorow for Sin, is ever accompanied with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain spiritual Comfort and Joy, arising from the encouragement of God's Mercy: And therefore as those, who seem to repent of Sin, and have not that true <hi>Sorrow</hi> as they ought, are wanting in the consideration of God's <hi>Goodness,</hi> which they have abus'd, and of his <hi>Justice,</hi> which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd; so likewise, they, who with the <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> of having offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, have not this interior <hi>Comfort,</hi> are most certainly wanting in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:206808:18"/>
                  <hi>Confidence</hi> they ought to repose in him.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Comfort</hi> ever attends the <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of a true Penitent, and bearing up his Spirits, hinders him from falling into Dejection of mind: And a like Comfort he ever preserves, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the Snares, by which the Devil labours to cast him down and draw him into the Darkness of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. For if the thoughts of his <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Failings,</hi> of his <hi>not being true to his good Purposes,</hi> &amp;c. press on him and begin to seize him with terror; he forthwith endeavours not to lose his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Peace, but seriously resolves to use the best of his care for the future to prevent the like; repents of them, as they are an <hi>Offence against God;</hi> but as they are <hi>Troublesome to himself,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to bear them with <hi>Patience;</hi> knowing it his Duty to bear patiently with his own defects, as well as with those of others: Thus has he a <hi>Zeal for Justice,</hi> which makes him <hi>hate his Sins,</hi> and that <hi>Patience,</hi> which makes him suffer the <hi>Trouble</hi> of them: Thus he wages a continual War against his Imperfections, and nevertheless so bears with himself and them, as not to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:206808:18"/> give himself up to Melancholy and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; striving ever to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that measure of Grace, God is pleas'd to bestow on him: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that <hi>anxiety</hi> and <hi>disquiet</hi> of Mind, to which he observes himself naturally inclin'd, on these occasions, to be nothing better than Passion, to be the effects of Impatience and Pride, because he is not so constant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular as he would be.</p>
               <p>Again, If he preceives himself to be in a state of Coldness and Insensibility; or that he is so closely assaulted with all sorts of Temptations, and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting thoughts, that he cannot begin to Pray, Read, or think of his Soul and Eternity, but presently a thousand idle fancies croud about him quite distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Mind, and that he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this Indisposition: He notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, still labours to preserve his inward Peace, looks on this as a spiritual Affliction, sent him by the just hand of God; thinks it his great duty, with all Humility, to submit to these his appointments; and hopes, if he truly humbles himself and quietly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to this his Will, he may draw as much profit thence, as if it had pleas'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:206808:19"/> his Divine Majesty to have fill'd him with more sensible devotion; because he considers, that tho fervent and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Prayer be very acceptable, yet that <hi>resisting Temptations with Constancy and Courage,</hi> and <hi>a patient submission to the state that God appoints,</hi> is the Exercise of very good Christians, and no less acceptable to Heaven. Hence it is, that though he often sends up his Sighs to God; saying, <hi>Domine usque quo!</hi> Lord, how long shall I live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort! Yet he still continues in Peace, resolves more and more to humble himself, and to admit no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, in the Darkness wherein he is left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In this manner, I see you'll not allow of Sadness or Melancholy in a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, upon any account whatsoever; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the account of <hi>Exterior Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or upon the consideration of his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, Inconstancy</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> or in time of <hi>Temptation,</hi> or <hi>Interior Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> but conclude it to be every where a Weakness and Indisposition of the Mind: And if this be so, may not I here conclude, that great numbers of well-meaning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians deceive themselves in this Affair, while they indulge themselves in <hi>Sadness,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:206808:19"/> and think they do no harm? But now, one question more, and I leave my self to your directions: What do you think of such, as being of a Melancholy disposition, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten overwhelm'd with Sadness, and know not why: Would willingly be deliver'd from it, and know not how; And hence, are under great Oppressions, Disquiets and Terrors, and render'd unfit for every Christian duty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are truly to be pitied, and must consult how much they stand in need of the Physicians help; for tho' they are under an Evil, that effects the Mind, yet the Cure of it depends much on the disposition of the Body. As to the Nature of it, as it falls here under my consideration; I think 'tis of it self, very prejudicial to all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in virtue, 'tis injurious to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, expos'd to many Temptations, and is attended with most of those ill consequences set down in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter, as flowing from Sadness: And it being thus pernicious in it self, and fatal to all Christian, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Personal Duties, as those know too well, by their experience, who are subject to this Evil; I cannot here omit laying before them the strict
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:206808:20"/> obligation they are under, of using all endeavours to prevent at lest their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into it: For tho, when they are in the height of this distemper, and are now oppress'd with the violence of its terrors, they are then, it may be, so disabled, that they can make but very weak resistance against it; yet they have much more in their power when they observe it to begin to creep upon them; and then it is they ought to stir themselves up, and courageously make head against it, as knowing, that if they do'nt then suppress it, they are in evident danger of being made Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by it. How then, are these bound in their intervals of quiet, to prepare and arm themselves with Patience, Humility and Resignation? How jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and fearful ought they to be of every little disquieting thought? How ready to check all apprehensions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury or contempt? How careful to put a stop to the earnest workings of their Imagination and Reasoning? How watchful to remove every little Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viness or Dulness, that begins to seize them? How ought they, in all these occasions, strive to deny themselves, stand up against the Temptation, seek
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:206808:20"/> some way to divert the Evil, either by innocent Company, Conversation, and above all, have recourse to a good Book, to Prayer and seek help from above? For, 'tis not to be question'd, but such timely endeavours would be very beneficial for the preventing the distempers growing to a head; and I am certain, that if upon the <hi>first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Trouble or Heaviness creeping on their Spirits,</hi> they would forthwith consider it, as an <hi>Affliction from the hand of God,</hi> and so strive to accept it as such, not only with <hi>Patience,</hi> but, as they are bound, with <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Cheerfulness</hi> too: These endeavours would be bless'd with good effects, and not only be an easie, but often a total removal of the Burthen.</p>
               <p>In this manner must these labour; and without it they discharge not a good Conscience: For tho in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of a more easie and cheerful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a slight and passing Trouble, a little discontent, or other disorder may not be very criminal, because they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily cast it off, and are not in that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent danger of falling into the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Passion; yet in these it is far otherwise; for since every little disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:206808:21"/> in them is but too often the way to a greater, and a small disturbance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly grows upon them, till 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their power to master it, and so disables them, that they are not in a condition of performing well any Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty either to God or Man; hence are they bound to be more watchful over themselves, and upon the first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any Disturbance and Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, make a speedy opposition and labour to cast it off; as looking on it, not as it is inconsiderable in its first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, but as it is terrible in all those Consequences, which are too likely to attend it, if not prevented by an early resistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> There's too much reason for this, and I wish the persons concern'd would duely consider it; 'twould be very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the health and quiet both of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul. But now you have laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me the nature of this Distemper and method of the Cure; you must in the next place let me know somthing of the Practice of it, and tell me what Devotions and Books are most proper for the working this good effect, which you propose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All spiritual Books are helpful for this end: However, since some
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:206808:21"/> parts of them may be more seasonable and effectual than others, I'll here give you a short Collection of Devotions and Lessons, which in time of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Disquiet and Sadness, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the affording some Relief. And tho a Person, in those Circumstances, finds himself indispos'd for this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; yet since God has promis'd to hear such as call upon him in time of Tribulation; since 'tis not only in time of Light and Comfort, but in Anguish and Darkness, we are commanded to bless him: <hi>Benedicite Lux &amp; Tenebrae Dominum.</hi> Light and Darkness, Bless our Lord. Therefore a Christian, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his Interiour Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Darkness, ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to to God, in the Best manner he is able; for he that knows his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition, has goodness to pardon his Defects and accept his Desires.</p>

                  <p>WIth Patience let us run the race that is set before us; looking upon Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our Faith, who for the Joy, that was set before him, endur'd the Cross, contemning the shame <hi>thereof,</hi> and is now seated at the right hand of the Throne of God. Think upon him, who suffer'd such contradiction from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that you be not discourag'd, or dejected in Mind. For as yet you have not made resistance to Blood, in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against Sin. Have you forgot that Comfort, which is spoke to you, as to Children? My Son, despise not the Correction of thy Lord, and be not cast down, when thou art Reprov'd by him: For our Lord Chastises him whom he loves, and Scourges every one, whom he receives as a Son Be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous <hi>therefore</hi> under Sufferings; God treats you as his Children: For, what Son is there, whom the Father does not Correct? If you are without Suffering, in which all have had their share, then are you illegitimate, and not true Children. Besides, we have had Fathers of our Flesh, who have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:206808:25"/> Corrected us, and yet we gave them respect. Shall we not be much more obedient to the Father of <hi>our</hi> Spirits, and live? For they chastis'd us as they thought good, and in <hi>order to</hi> this life, which is short: But God punishes us as it may be for our advantage; for our being made partakers of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. No punishment, while we are under it, seems comfortable, but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom; but afterwards it brings forth the peaceable Fruit of Justice, to such as have been Exercised by it.</p>
                  <p>Blessed is he, that suffers Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for when he has been tried, he shall receive a Crown of Glory, which God has promis'd to those that love him. As the sufferings of Christ abound in us; so likewise through Christ, our comfort abounds: For if we suffer with him, we shall be glorified with him, and receive the crown of Glory, which God has promis'd to those that love him.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:206808:26"/> you; but rejoice in your having a part in the Sufferings of Christ, that you may be fill'd with joy in the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of his Glory. If you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd for the name of Christ, blessed are you; because the honour, glory and power of God and his Spirit rests on you. But let none of you suffer as a Murtherer, or Thief, or a worker of Evil, or a designer of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wrong. But if any one suffers, as a Christian, let him not be asham'd, but glorifie God in this name. For the time is now come, that Jugdment begins in the House of God: And if it begins with us, what shall their end be, who believes not the Gospel of our Lord? And if the Just shall scarce be sav'd; where shall the wicked and sinners appear? Wherefore, let those that suffer according to the Will of God, commend their Souls in good Works to their faithful Creator.</p>
                  <p>Let none return Evil for Evil, but overcome Evil with Good; Bless those that Curse you; for in this are you call'd, that you may inherit a Blessing: If you suffer for Justice. blessed are you. 'Tis better be afflicted, if God so will, in doing our duty, than suffer

                  <p>IN this one point consists the sum of Christian Perfection, to receive whatever happens, with a peaceable Mind, as coming from the hand of God; to cast all our care on him, because he watches over us, and nothing befalls us, but according to his Appointment. In this Will of God, is grounded all the quiet and peace of a Christian. And tho sin be from our selves, and not from him; yet in our Repentance ought we be very careful not to fall into any anxiety or disquiet of Mind. We are to be heartily sorry indeed, for having offended our God, and even
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:206808:32"/> with Tears strive to wash away our Guilt; but this Sorrow must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy our inward Peace; we must ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly beg God's Mercy, who has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted us to fall, that so we might be sensible of our Weakness, that so we may ever go on with fear, and not deceive our selves, in taking that to be ours, which is only the gift of God. We must wait with patience and in a contrite Heart, the grace of Amendment; for he is our Lord, and will come when he pleases. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and prudent Servant, desires, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the Will of his Master; and in every thing that happens, he says from his Heart, <hi>It is so, Father, because thus it has seem'd good to thee: Thy Will be done.</hi> I am ready to submit to all thy Decrees: Wilt thou that I be in Health, or in Sickness? Wilt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh me with thy Comforts, or cover me with Darkness? Wilt thou that I Abound, or be in Want? What thou wilt, that I will: Do with me as thou pleasest. This is the temper of a Mind indifferent to all the Appointments of God, that makes a Christian ever cheerful and constant, and secures him against all Disquiets.</p>

                  <p>Let my Soul be subject to my God; for who is there that resists against him, and has peace within? If I am to keep peace with all, let me in the first place study to preserve my peace with God; for I am but Dust and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and what can be sufficient to make me rebell against my Maker? Be thou my help, O my God, and my strength: Support me in all Evils and give me Patience; direct me in my Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and while I distrust in my self, let me ever conside in thee; for thus only can I preserve my Peace with God.</p>

                  <p>CHrist said to his Disciples; I leave you my Peace, my Peace I give you; I give you Peace, not as the Wold gives it. All desire Peace, but few take care to do such things, as are proper for the obtaining it. My Peace is with the humble and meek of heart. Thou shalt enjoy an interior quiet, if thou hast much Patience: And if thou giv'st ear to me and follow'st my voice,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:206808:37"/> Peace shall not be wanting to thee. For the purchase of so great a good, be very attentive to what thou say'st or dost: direct thy whole intention to this, that thou may'st please me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and seek nothing out of me Judge nothing rashly of the words or actions of others; and meddle not with things that belong not to thee, for thus shalt thou be little or seldom troubled. But never to feel any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at all, or to be sensible of no grief, either of mind or body, is not the condition of this life, but of everlasting Rest. Think not therefore thou hast found true Peace, if thou feel'st no sorrow; or that all is well, if thou hast no adversary; or that all is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if thou hast great Devotion and sweetness: No, Christian perfection consists not in this, but in offering thy self entirely to my Will, without seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy own Interest or Ease in great or little; accepting, whether Good or Evil, with an equal countenance, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thanks alike for both, and being indifferent to all that comes from me. If thy Hope be so firm, and thy Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage so great, that when inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is withdrawn from thee, thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'st
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:206808:37"/> thy self to suffer yet more, and think'st not of justifying thy self, as if thou deserv'st not to suffer so much; but ever striv'st to praise my Name in all whatever I appoint for thee, then art thou in the way of Peace.</p>
                  <p>The days of this life are short and evil, full of sorrow and anguish, where man is disturb'd with many Passions, distracted with vanities and defil'd with Sin. O, when shall these Evils be at an end! When shall I be deliver'd from this miserable bondage, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly rejoyce in thee my Lord, where I shall no more be distracted with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, nor be defil'd with Sin.</p>

                  <p>SON, Humility and Patience in time of Adversity, are more pleasing to me, than much Comfort and Devotion in time of Prosperity. Why art thou then disquieted at every little trouble that befalls thee? Tho it had been much greater, yet thou ought'st not to have been mov'd. Thou art cheerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, as long as thou hast nothing to suffer; thou can'st then give advice to others and encourage them by thy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:206808:38"/> words: But when any Tribulation sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises thee, then thou art destitute of all Counsel, and without strength! Consider this thy weakness, which thou experiencest in every small occasion, which is yet permitted for thy greater good. Chace away therefore all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from thy heart, as well as thou can'st; and if it begins to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, yet suffer it not to deject thee or seise thy Spirits: Bear it at least with Patience, if thou can'st not with Joy. The Storm which is rais'd, will quickly be follow'd with a Calm; and thy inward grief shall be sweetned with the return of Grace. I still live, says our Lord, and am ready to help thee, and give thee greater comfort than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if thou puttest thy trust in me, and devoutly call'st on me. Take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage therefore and arm thy self with Patience, to suffer yet more: All is not lost, if thou feel'st thy self often Afficted, or violently Tempted. Thou art a Man, and not God; thou art Flesh and not an Angel: How canst thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to continue ever in the same state of Vertue, when an Angel has fallen from Heaven, and the first Man lost his standing in Paradise? I am he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:206808:38"/> who comforts those that Mourn, and raise up such as know their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, evey to the partaking of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
                  <p>Blessed for ever be thy Sacred Word O Lord, sweeter to my Mouth than Honey. What should I do in my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and Anguish, if thou did'st not vouchsafe to comfort me! What mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it, how much or how long I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, so that I may but at length arrive at the Haven of Bliss? Be mindful of me and direct me, and now I am in the Narrow way, O God, vouchsafe to comfort me.</p>

                  <p>THere is no Security in this Life; as long as it lasts, thou shalt ever have need of spiritual Armour. Thou liv'st in the midst of Enemies; and if thou defendest not thy self with the shield of Patience, thou canst not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape long without hurt. If thou takest not care to fix thy Heart on God, and to suffer all for his sake, thou canst not sustain the heat of this Battle, nor obtain the Crown of Victory and Bliss: Thou ought'st therefore with courage,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:206808:39"/> force thy Enemies, and make thy way through all that stands before thee; for the Manna is not given but to the Conquerors, whilst Misery is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Negligent. If thou seek'st after the deceitful Comforts of this World, how wilt thou find true Rest in the other? be not sollicitous for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying much Ease, but rather to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Patience. Seek true Peace, not on Earth, but in Heaven: And for the love of God, be ready to suffer all manner of Troubles, Grief, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Anxieties, Necessities, Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Injuries, Detractions, Reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Humiliations, Corrections and Contempts: For these are so many steps to Vertue: These are the Trials and Exercises of a Soldier of Christ: These are the Pearls that make up the Heavenly Crown. Expect not always to have Spiritual Comforts; my Saints had not so; but were tried with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Afflictions and Temptations, which they indur'd with great Patience, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting not in themselves, but in God; and ever remembring that the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Life are a very easie Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of the Glory to come. Wilt thou have that in an Instant, which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:206808:39"/> they obtain'd not but with many Tears and lasting Troubles? Wait for help from above; act with Courage and Constancy; Fear not; Fly not, but offer Body and Soul for the glory of God; and he will be thy Comfort in Tribulations, and afterwards thy plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Reward.</p>
                  <p>This is a hard saying; Deny thy self, take up thy Cross and follow Jesus: But it will be much harder to hear that last word; Go ye Cursed, into everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Fire. How shall I bear everlasting Torments, who am so much disturb'd with Trifles! Give me thy Grace, O God, that with patience I may submit to all thy Appointments; and let me suffer here whatever thou pleasest, so I may never hear those words recall'd, <hi>Go, ye Cursed, into everlasting Fire.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord God, be not far from me; my God, have regard to help me; for afflicting thoughts have risen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, and great Fears darken and torment my Soul; and how shall I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, being thus weak and frail in the midst of so many powerful Enemies? But hast not thou promis'd, Lord, to help those who call upon thee in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, and give relief to such as are in Distress? Do then Lord, as thou hast said, fulfill thy words, and let all evils now be put to flight. This is my hope and only comfort, to flye under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of thy Wings; to trust in thee in all Trouble; to call on thee from my Heart, and wait with Patience, till thou shalt succour me.</p>
                  <p>Blessed be thy Name, O Lord, for ever, since it has pleas'd thee to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Temptation and Affliction to fall upon me. I cannot escape it; all I can do, is to have recourse to thee,

Lord, my Soul is now affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, it is not well with me, being much disquieted with this present Grif, that torments me. And now, beloved Father, what shall I say; I am in great extremity; 'tis now the hour of Combat; save me, O Lord, in this hour. But 'tis thou hast permmitted it, for the manifestation of thy Glory, in delivering me from such Straits. Let it please thee then Lord, to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me; for miserable wretch that I am, what can I do, and whither shall I go without thee! Grant me Patience Lord, even this time also. Help me, my God, and then, however Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations press heavy upon me, yet I will not fear.</p>
                  <p>And now, in this condition, what shall I say? Lord, thy will be done: I have truly deserv'd to be afflicted and griev'd; and certainly I ought to bear it; and would to God, I could bear it with patience, till the Storm be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and there succeed a Calm. But thy Almighty hand is able even now, to remove this Temptation from me, and abate its violence, that I sink not under it, as thou hast often already
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:206808:41"/> done, O God of Mercy: And the more unable I am to rescue my self from this evil, the more manifest will thy Power be, in working this Change by thy mighty Arm. O God be then to me a Jesus, and deliver me.</p>

                  <p>Accept, I beseech thee, dear Jesus, this Offering I now make; and from this hour, take my Soul and Body, my Thoughts, my Words and Actions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Mercy and Protection, that I may faithfully serve thee, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; and that neither Life nor Death, Plenty, nor Want; neither Temptation nor Peace, Joy nor Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

                  <p>For this end, I now desire with all my Soul, to renounce my self, and that my Will for the future be ever conform'd to thine. I desire thee to dispose of me and whatever belongs to me, in the manner thou pleasest, and as it shall be most for thy glory. And I now desire to be content with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lot thou hast appointed for me, whether Good or Evil. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to Sickness, Poverty, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, Grief, Desolation, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Suffering; may they be all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me, O God, as they come from thy hand: May I submit to all, be content with all, and even rejoyce in all; because 'tis all the fulfilling of thy Will.

                  <head>VIII. In any Publick Calamity.</head>
                  <p>ALmighty and Everlasting God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies and God of all comfort, have regard to us miserable and unworthy Sinners, who in our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress and necessities, with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, seek to thee for help. Thy hand is upon us, and we are severely Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; Tribulation is on every side. And we, what shall we say to these things, O dreadful Lord! Thou art Just, O God, and thy Judgments are unquestionable: The evils with which thou visitest us, we confess to be the just Scourges of thy Anger, which we have provok'd. For thou visitest our iniquities with thy Rod, and our Sins with thy Scourge, because we have so rebelliously offended against thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty: We have sin'd, O Lord, against Heaven, and done Evil in thy sight; by our Iniquities we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unworthy to appear in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or to lift up our Eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>But look not, O Lord, so much on our wickedness, as to forget thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for as thou art Just, so thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:206808:46"/> are above all thy Works: And if thou only regardest our Iniquities, Lord, who shall be able to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee? Moderate therefore, we beseech thee, O merciful God, the rigour of thy Justice, and deal not with us according to our Sins, nor punish us according to our Iniquities; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of thy tender Mercies turn away thy Anger from us.</p>
                  <p>We are truly sorry for having so grievously offended against thee, and by our transgressions provok'd thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and therefore in a Contrite and humble heart, we now fly to the Throne of thy Grace and Goodness; and there, prostrating our selves, with our whole trust in thy infinite Mercies, beg thee to have compassion in our Misery, and not wholly abandon us to the fury of thy just Revenge.</p>
                  <p>Look, we beseech thee, on the face of thy Christ, who has purchas'd us by his Death; be mindful of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and Covenant thou hast made with thy People, and which has been Seal'd with the Blood of thy beloved Son, our Redeemer Jesus Christ: Have regard to the honour of thy Name, which is now invok'd by thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:206808:47"/> but blasphem'd by thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>And because we are unworthy, of our selves, to be partakers of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of thy Goodness; at least for thy own sake, and for the glory of thy Holy Name, be merciful to us, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, and forgive us our Sins: Let that thy unspeakable Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness move thee, which prevail'd on thee to send thy Only Son for our Redemption. And we beseech thee, by the same Lord Jesus our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by his most bitter Passion and Death, have regard to our Prayers, hear our Cry, and consider the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy People: For thou alone art our Protector and Deliverer.</p>

And if thou thinkst thou art severely dealt with, raise thy Thoughts a little, and hear that last Sentance pronounced, of, <hi>Go you accursed, into Eternal Fire.</hi> O, if thou wert one of that wretched Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and now in the moment of sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Hell, wouldst not thou esteem it a Mercy, to have that sad Doom exchang'd into the Pain thou now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'st?

Thanks therefore be to thee O Lord, for all thy Mercies, and now withal my Soul, I bless thy Name, and blessed be it for ever.</p>
                  <p>But still I want Patience, I am still uneasie. And is not this because thou art infirm and weak, and know'st not the ways of thy Lord? Thou hast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thy time to offend, and he now takes his time to punish thee.

He was mine, 'tis true, but he was more thine; and if thou hast dispos'd of what is thy own, according to thy good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, what part of a Christian is it now to be disturb'd at thy Appointments? In vain have I so many years repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:206808:54"/> to thee my God, <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi> if now, when thou hast evidently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested thy Will to me, I cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it; is not this a sign, I more admire thy Blessings than the hand that gave them; and that I more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore my own Satisfaction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, than the accomplishment of thy Will, which ought to be to us, above all, Adorable?</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, something is to be allow'd to Nature and Decency, to mourn and grieve a little, at the loss of what was so dear; but if this becomes immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, 'tis then the Grief of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, for Christianity allows of no Excess. This requires of me to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate all my Passions, to deny my self, and not to leave that to be done by Time, which Reason and Religion ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Ah, my Soul, shew my self then a Christian now, and let not the loss of a Creature, put thee in danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thy Creator too. Tho it be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to submit, yet beg assistance from above, force Nature to yield to the Lord of all; and now, even against thy Inclination, cry out, Thou art Just, O Lord, in all thy ways; thy Will be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:206808:55"/> be done, thy Will be done now, and for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Lord, I leave my self, and all in thy hands, desiring truly to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my self under thy Rod, and beg, that as it is for the punishment of my Sins, so it may be for the amendment of my Life. Help me, dear Jesus, in this, and be thou my Comforter, both now and to all Eternity. And see thou my Soul, thou strive to make him so to thee; for if he cannot supply this loss and relieve thy Soul, is it not because the Creature is greater to thee than thy God? O Jesu, be now to me my God, my Helper and my Deliverer.</p>

                  <p>O Merciful Jesu, who hast promis'd to be found by those that seek thee, have compassion on this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unworthy Sinner, and fulfil thy Word in me. For behold, I am tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sensible of my own Weakness and of the truth of what thou hast said, That without thee, I can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and therefore I now humbly make my address to thy Goodness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching thee, that thou would'st
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:206808:55"/> vouchsafe to be found by me, that thou would'st give me the grace of seeking thee with a sincere heart, that the impressions of Education may not make me obstinate against thy Truth; that neither Interest or Compliance or any other human respect whatever may biass me in my choice; but that looking for thee, with all sincerity, I may be rais'd above all these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and suffer nothing of Earth to put me out of the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>O God, what have I on Earth, and, besides thee, what have I'in Heaven! Was not I made for thee; and if I lose thee, is there any thing on Earth, can make me for ever happy! Is there any thing here can recompense the loss of my Soul? O Jesu, far be it from me, to run this hazard: Thou hast taught me in thy Passion the true worth of a Soul; and when I consider how much thou suffer'dst, to purchase happiness for me, do not I there see, how much I ought to suffer to prevent the ruin of my Soul? O God, permit me not, I beseech thee, to cast away upon this World, what has cost thee the Blood of thy only Son.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:206808:56"/>
                  <p>No, my God, I desire ever to be thine, and here in thy presence I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, thou art to me, above all the World, I renounce all for the sake of thee. Have regard to me therefore at present, and take me into thy Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; defend me from all delusions, remove all darkness from my Soul, and mercifully lead me into thy Truth. If it be thy way, in which I walk at present, preserve me for ever in it, and let me rather suffer a thousand deaths, than depart from it: But if I have been hitherto in error, deliver me, I beseech thee, from it; open then the way to me, shew me thy paths and guide me into thy Truth, for where thou art, there I desire to be; I desire to be in thy way, that I may faithfully serve thee, and that I may find thee at the end of my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Grant me, O God, this my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, for the love of thy only Son; for in thee I put my trust.</p>

               <p>HEre I have set down a Collection of some Lessons rnd Prayers, which may give some relief in time of Affliction and Sadness; I cannot promise they will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways said with this good effect, and yet I

                  <head>Instructions and Devotions for the Sick.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> WHen a Person is seiz'd with sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, what ought to be his chief Concern?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To consider the State of his Soul, and resolve upon using all the means proper for making his peace with God, and putring himself in that condition, that if Almighty God shall please to call him out of this World, he may not be found unprepar'd. No delays ought to be admitted in this Affair; because, to prepare for <hi>Dying well;</hi> is a great Work. They who have liv'd
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:206808:58"/> well, have made the surest preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it; and yet even these too will find enough to do in the time of their Sickness, for fitting their Souls for this last passage; how much more then will those have upon their hands, who in their Lives have forsaken God, and been wanting to many Christian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? As for such, who have liv'd in <hi>Willful and known Sins,</hi> and on their Death-bed, seem to return to God and ask for mercy, I must say with many Fathers, Their case is <hi>very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,</hi> if not <hi>Desperate;</hi> I can promise nothing to such late endeavours, which are very seldom sincere; however since none ought to despair, I wish all sorts would make the best use of their Sickness, which is a Call from Heaven to prepare for Eternity: Those who have liv'd best, will certainly go on with the greater Confidence in God; and as for the others, Who knows, but God may shew mercy to them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st.</hi> Then let the sick Person, whilst he sends for the Physian, or such as may take care of his Health, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to call for his spiritual Physitian too, who may help to put his Soul in a good state.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:206808:58"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> Let him engage his best Friends, to discover to him the danger of his Distemper, as soon as they apprehend any; and desire them not to flatter him with the hopes of recovery, when in reality there appears none; that so, he may dispose his Soul for what God has appointed for him, and not be surpris'd with suddain and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Death. For 'tis most certainly a very unfriendly part, to delude a sick Person with these false hopes, and on pretext of not disturbing him, to take out of his hands the opportunity, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more to be recover'd, of preparing his Soul to appear before his Lord; this is a sort of Friendship very barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and cruel, whilst for the preserving a short Peace, is ventur'd the loss of that which is Eternal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly</hi> If he has not his Will already made (as in Prudence he ought) let him be careful in the beginning of his Sickness, to call for such experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd Persons, as may help him to make it; that so having settled all Temporal Affairs, he may wholly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his thoughts afterwards, without any disturbance, to the care of his Soul. This it is in which many, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:206808:59"/> good People are very much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen; neglecting to make their Wills in time of Health, as if they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to think of dying, and then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it off still in time of Sickness; So that, as it too often happens, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye without a Will, or else make it in such disorder, that they Entail on their Friends and Relations lasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and endless Expences, which might have been prevented by their timely care, and will most certainly be severely laid to their Charge, who by their affected neglect have given the occasion of these Disorders and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly.</hi> If he be in Debt, or has any Restitution to make, let him take care for the satisfying these Obligations to the best of his power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>5thly.</hi> Let him be mindful to forgive all those, who have any ways injur'd him, and beg pardon of as many, as he has wrong'd either in word or deed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>6thly.</hi> If the Distemper be dangerous, let him admit but few visits, since the Discourses of most People, are only so many distractions, and help to bring the World in, to one who is going out of it.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:206808:59"/>
                  <p>The reason why these things ought to be done in the beginning of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is, because many Distempers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly fly up into the Head, and deprive a Man of all Reason and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and where the Disease spares the Brain, the Physician very often do's not, prescribing Remedies, which lay him into such a dozing sleepiness, that, it may be, he never more comes truly to himself again; but go's sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and senseless out the World. Thus, whether from the Disease or the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, an opportunity of settling these Affairs, lost in the beginning, proves but too often past all recovery; and therefore in Prudence ought not to be neglected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q</hi> What method do you propose to be us'd in time of Sickness, as most proper to prepare a Christian for his last hour, and fit him to appear before his Judge?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There can be no one Method fit for all, but a great deal must be left to Discretion, in compliance to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cases and Circumstances. But however, it being most certain, that a Soul without a <hi>True Faith</hi> in God, without <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in his Goodness, without <hi>Charity,</hi> without
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:206808:60"/> a <hi>sincere Repentance,</hi> without <hi>Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Patience,</hi> &amp;c. is very unfit to be presented before the Judgment Seat, therefore it is absolutely necessary, in time of Sickness, care should be taken to establish a Soul in these Vertues; that so being purified from all Sin, it may be found cloath'd in its Wedding Garments, and thus enter into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. A good director and Pious Books will be helpful for this end: But for such as are not better provided, I'll here set down a short Collection of Devotions, by which it may be in the power of any charitable Friend, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist his Neighbour for the doing this Great Work, which being once well done, will be an Everlasting Blessing.</p>

                  <p>LOrd Jesus Christ, behold I receive this Sickness, with which thou art pleas'd to visit me, as from thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly hand: 'Tis thy Will it should be thus with me, and therefore I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.

For I am thy Creature, O Lord, who have most ungratefully of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended against thee, and since my Sins have a long time call'd aloud to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Justice; why shall I now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, if I feel thy hand upon me? No, my God, thou art just in all thy ways; I have truly deserv'd thy Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments; and therefore I have no reason to complain of thee, but only of my own Wickedness.</p>
                  <p>But correct me not, O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee in thy Anger; but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my Weakness. Thou know'st, how frail I am; that I am nothing but Dust and Ashes: deal not with me therefore according to my Sins, neither punish me according to my Iniquities; but according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy most tender Mercies have compassion on me. Let thy Mercy come mixt with thy Justice, and let thy Grace be my support in my Sickness Confirm my Soul with strength from above, that I may bear with Patience all the uneasiness, pains, disquiets and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:206808:61"/> difficulties of my Illness; that I may cheerfully accept them, as the just punishment of my Offences: Preserve me from all Temptations, and be thou my Defence against all assaults of the Enemy; that in this Sickness I may no ways offend thee. And if this is to be my last, I beg of thee, so to direct me by thy Grace, that I may no ways neglect or be depriv'd of those Means, which thou hast, in thy Mercy ordain'd, for the good of my Soul, to prepare it for its passage into Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that being perfectly cleans'd from all my Iniquities, I may believe in thee, love thee, put my whole Trust in thee, and through the Merits of thy Death and Passion be admitted into the Company of the Blessed, where I may praise thee for ever, Amen</p>

He is sweet and tender to all, and his Mercies are above all his Works. He gives strength to the weak, raises up those that fall, comforts the Afflicted, and pardons Sinners. O God, all these good effects, I hope, thou wilt at present work in my Soul, and so watch over me, that nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for my Salvation be wanting to me.</p>

                  <p>I Love thee, my Lord God, and 'tis my hearty desire to encrease still more and more in thy love; that I may love thee as thou hast commanded, with all my Heart, with all my Soul, and with all my Strength. Thou art to me, all in all, and out of thee, there is nothing able to help me, or worthy of my Love. O infinite Goodness, when shall I perfectly love thee? When wilt thou wholly possess my Heart?

                  <p>I love thee, O Lord, my Strength; thou art my Defence and my Refuge, thou art my Deliverer. 'Tis good for me to depend wholly on my God, and in him to put my Trust. For, what is there in Heaven besides thee; and out of thee, what have I to seek on Earth; As the Hart pants after the Fountains of Water, so does my Soul after thee, O Lord. My Soul thirsts after my Lord, the Fountain of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Water; when shall I come and appear before the face of my God? Into thy hands I commend my Spirit? thou hast redeem'd me, O God of Truth. Who shall separate me from this love of Christ? Shall Tribulation, or Necessity? Shall Sickness, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, or Pain? No; all these I hope
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:206808:64"/> to overcome, through him that has lov'd us.

                  <p>I Will speak to our Lord, who am but Dust and Ashes, and as the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that passes away. Remember, Lord, what I am, and what my Being is: Remember thou hast made me as Clay, and into Earth I shall return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Shew not therefore thy Power against me for what strength have I to bear it; and how shall I, being so weak as I am, hold out with Patience? Why then has my Lord stretch'd forth his hand against me, let this disorder seize on my Spirits, and cast me on the Bed of Sickness? But why do I now lift up my head against Heaven, and appear uneasie under the Decrees of the Almighty? No, I will rather chuse to say, 'Tis our Lord has given Health and Strength; 'tis our Lord has taken it away; as it has seem'd

Thus I say, my God, thus I think: Thou art Just, O Lord; thy Judgment is right; I have deserv'd far greater Punishment than this: Were I to be my own Judge, and the punisher of my own Wickedness, I could take off nothing of the Evil I now suffer.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge, in what I feel, the hand of a tender Father Chastising a rebellious Child; it is not the Arm of a severe Judge punishing me in the justice of his Wrath: But however, this one thing, O merciful Father, I ask of thee, that thou would'st re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I am; that I am Frail and Weak; that of my self, I can do nothing, and how much I stand in need of thy Grace to support and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me. Grant me, therefore, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, strength to suffer; give me Patience; for this is necessary for me: Grant this my request, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, my heart is ready, O Lord, my heart is ready, to accept whatever thou art pleas'd to lay on me, and even to be comforted under thy Scourge. Let it be the effect of thy Mercy, that in Patience I may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess

For this end, I will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten look on the face of thy Christ, that by considering him, who suffer'd so much for me, I may be encourag'd to suffer. He became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross: But as for me, I have not yet resisted to Blood, I have yet suffer'd but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: But how much shall I then suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, when the time shall come, that the pangs of Death seize upon me!</p>
                  <p>O God, thou art my Strength and my Refuge? on thee I depend for help in the day of Battle: Thou wilt then try me, and thou must be then my Comforter thou wilt try me like Gold in the Furnace: stand thou ever by me, and forsake me not in my Necessities, that so I may be found worthy of thee. I know indeed, the sufferings of this Life, are nothing, if compar'd to that Glory, which shall be reveal'd in us.

I don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the fulness of Consolation without any Suffering, for that's the Life of Glory; neither do I desire to be in a fulness of Evils without Comfort, this is the State of Unbelievers But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, Lord, to feel the sadness of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for my Sins, and the Comforts of thy Spirit by thy Grace, for that's the true State of Christianity. Let me feel Sadness and Comfort both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that I may at length come to that happy State of being fill'd with thy Consolations without any Grief. For, Lord, thou didst let the World langush without Consolation, before the coming of thy Only Son; now thou comfortest and soften'st the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of thy Children by the Grace of thy Beloved Son; and thou wilt fill with perfect happiness thy Saints in the participation of his Glory: These are the admirable steps, by which thou furnishest thy Works: Thou hast drawn me out of the First, make me pass through the Second, that so I may arrive at length at the Third, in which I may praise thee for ever. Lord, it is what I heartily beg of thee.</p>

'Tis a confusion to me to think that whilst thou didst sweat Blood to expiate my Offences, I should be bent on nothing but Quiet and Ease 'Tis a greater reproach to me, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving renounced the World solemnly in the face of the Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liev'd. that thou becam'st a Sacrifice for my Salvation; that the Pleasures and Sins of the World were the only subject of thy Sufferings; that the World it self was thy Executioner, that persecuted and crucified Thee: and yet, notwithstanding the Faith of these Truths: that I have all my life been fond of this same World, and indulg'd my self in these same Sins and Pleasures.

               <p>Lastly, I commend my Soul to God my Creator, who made me of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: to Christ my Saviour, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd me with his precious Blood; to the Holy Ghost, who Sanctified me in the Water of Baptism. Into thy hands O Lord, I commend my Spirit: Be merciful, O God, to me a sinner.</p>
               <p>I likewise declare, that whenever the time comes, that I shall be labouring in my Agony, and shall be then able to speak no more, that I desire even then to be united to my God in my heart and mind and now, for then, offer to him, my Agony, my Sweats, my Pains and Distress, to be United to the Bloody Sweat, to the Grief and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my dear Redeemer Jesus Christ, for the remission of my sins,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:206808:100"/> and the eternal Glory of his Name: and I desire all the Holy Angels, whom God has commanded to take care of me, to defend me from the power of darkness, and all evil Spirits at my last hour.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> This Preparation for Confession and Exercise of Repentance, is very long: Is it all necessary for a Sick Person before he makes his Confession?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> It may not be all necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis to be hop'd, there are many live so well, and with Souls so truly dispos'd, that they stand not in need of so long a Preparation: and 'tis most certain, there are many others, who through the sharpness of their Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or stupifying qualities of their Physick, have not time to make use of it. But 'tis here set down for such as are under a more tedious Sickness, and are in a daily necessity of some Spiritual helps, to keep their Souls in a due disposition, and to be ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for the last Summons.</p>
               <p>It may be likewiise very proper for those, who, having liv'd something irregularly, are surpris'd with sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, when they are very unfit to die. For 'tis very necessary these should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:206808:100"/> by frequent and repeated Acts of the <hi>Detestation of Sin,</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> of <hi>Contrition,</hi> of the <hi>love of God, &amp;c.</hi> to change their hearts, and so by degrees remove that indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion strengthen'd in them through the long habit of sin. For since their thoughts of making their Confession in time of Sickness, is only occasion'd by their Distemper, there's great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be jealous of such Confessions, and to fear that 'tis only their present Circumstances, and not any detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin, or love of God, or any change of heart is the true motive of their present Devotion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho' such Confessions may be a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to their Friends, yet God knows how much it will avail them. For this reason, as often as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers will permit, 'tis not fit such Persons should be hasten'd to Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but all care us'd by those that assist them, first to prepare them well-to make them sensible, what true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is, by often reading and praying, to stir up in their hearts a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere abhorrence of their past life, quicken their Faith. strengthen their Hope, and bring them insensibly to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:206808:101"/> the love of God, and true Spirit of Penance; by this Method their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, tho' late, may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they may have reason to bless God for the well order'd Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such Friends; when otherwise, who knows, but they will have as great reason to curse those, who have accepted their hasty Confessions, and flatter'd them with false hopes upon an ill grounded and only superficial Repentance? Therefore I say, when the Distemper will give leave, great pains should be us'd for the preparing for, and making this last Confession at least a good one, on which Eternity so nearly depends.</p>

Accept at least this my hearty desire; and now, while it is the time of Mercy, look on me with Compassion, and have Mercy on me.

                  <p>Wherefore I here pour forth my Soul in Thanks to thee for all thy Blessings, for my Creation, for my Redemption by the Blood of thy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, for the infinite Mercies, whre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou hast so often rais'd me out of sin, prevented me by thy Grace, and call'd me out of Darkness into thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Light.

This nothing that I am, appeals to thy infinite Goodness and Love; and, through thy Sacred Wounds, and that Ocean of Mercy flowing from them, hopes to find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and be secure. I will drink the Cup thou giv'st me, I will take it ceerfully from thy hand, and drink it with thee, because thou hast first drank it for my Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Accept, Lord, my Heart, which I offer thee, as a Thanksgiving offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all thy Blessings; accept all that belongs to me; and thou, my Soul, bless thou thy Lord, and let thy Praise continue for ever. As for the World, renounce it all, because in thy God thou possessest all; renounce thy self, because thou art not thy own, but thine, O Lord; O, may I now no longer live, but thou in me: I love thee, O Jesus, with all my Heart, and with all my Soul.</p>
                  <p>Place me therefore near thee; O God, stand take me into thy Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then I will fear no evils, I will

               <head>Advice upon Recovery</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But if a Person recover from Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, what Devotion may be proper for him, upon his Recovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thanksgiving is due to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for all his Blessings, and therefore, when a Person is rais'd from the Bed of Sickness, he ought not to omit this Duty; which, I fear, is forgot by too many, who when they are in extremity of Pain or Sickness, know how to value Health and Ease, and in the earnestness of their Wishes, declare their Sense of such Blessings; and having receiv'd them, think no more of them, or of the Hand that gave them. This is a sort of Ingratitude very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Christian Spirit: And hence you may conclude, how much the Method of those is to be disapprov'd, who, after a fit of Sickness, Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate their first sitting up to a Game of Cards, and their first going abroad to a Play, or the <hi>Park, &amp;c.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the first Fruits of Health ought to be offer'd to God, as his Due, in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:206808:127"/> Prayer and going to Church: those that do otherwise, abuse his Gifts; and 'tis to be fear'd, that such as are hardy enough to do this, as soon as they are receiv'd, will not be more grateful afterwards. This is the Misery of two many, who perversly think, Prayers will do harm, when Cards will not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these get the start for some days; when God knows, the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Prayers, is but too often, much inferiour to that of Cards, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we consider the Time spent in these; and therefore not likely to be more prejudicial. But the truth is, we are all too apt to favour our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and a slender Reason is sufficient to promote what we have a mind to do: And thus we deceive our selves: When at the bottom there's only this; That we are ready to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more for our Diversion, than our Duty: And this makes those, who are afraid of their Prayer-Book, to be very bold at their Games.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Prayers would you direct them to, by way of Thanksgiving?</p>

            <head>INSTRUCTIONS AND DEVOTIONS For <hi>Prisoners,</hi> especially those, who are condemn'd to die.</head>
            <p>SUch Persons, who either by their Crimes, or false Accusations, or any other ways fall into the hands of Justice, and are thrown into Prison, ought to make an advantage of their misfortune, and improve it to the good of their Souls: Innocence in Confinement may find there the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of many Vertues, encourag'd by the Example of Christ and all his Glorious Confessors and Martyrs. Guilt in Confinement may find great Mercy attending the Justice of its
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:206808:128"/> Suffering, in the fairest opportunity offer'd for making Attonement for past offences. This seems to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Heaven, both as to the one and the other, and it must be a very great <hi>Abuse,</hi> not to comply with it, such as will sully the Innocence of the Cause on the one side, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the Guilt on the other, and in both render all their Suffering unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Wherefore great Caution is to be us'd by all in these Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In avoiding, as much as may be, the common Contagion of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that is, Ill Company, by which many, who have gone in Innocent, have come out Corrupt and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. And because the usual Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of fleeing such Conversations, is here often render'd Impracticable, therefore, is there a necessity of a more than ordinary Care, such as may secure Vertue in the midst of Corruption, and preserve a <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom.</hi> Guards are doubled in time of Danger, so it must be here: for that watchfullness, which was the Defence of Innocence in other places,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:206808:129"/> is not sufficient to withstand the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my here, which by the Advantage of the ground, is now much more powerful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In avoiding that too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Practice of Intemperance, which has many times the Authority of Men of Principles to recommend it. The Spirit in Confinement is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of Relief against all manner of Dejection, which for want of Employment or Diversion, is there too apt to seize it. Society is the obvious Remedy that presents it self, and wretched Custom persuading Men, there's no maintaining this without Drinking; hence this is Usher'd in under the cover of Necessity, or Convenience, and one Evil is made the Remedy of another; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Checks of Conscience attended the first Engagement, Practice soon wears out this uneasiness, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the Mind against all Scruples: Thus by degrees the life of a Prison becomes a life of continual Dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Intemperance, and of very unbecoming Entertainments, such as Exclude the Christian use of all their
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:206808:129"/> Sufferings, and deprive them of all that benefit Heaven has design'd for them. Those, who consider the Dispositions, with which all those Scourges, which come from the Hand of God, ought to be receiv'd; and that the time of Affliction is the time of Humiliation, of seeking Help and Comfort from God, will easily discover the unreasonableness of this Method, and that nothing can be more provoking, than to grow worse under Correction, and then to run into new Disorders, when they are call'd upon to retrench their old ones. Wherefore it must certainly be more adviseable, to submit to all manner of uneasiness, to seek Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Humility and Patience, to oblige Heaven to their Assistance by Prayer and Penance, to Mortifie themselves in all the inconveniencies of their Confinement: There's some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Gospel in this Spirit; but the other way is so far from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, that it gives Scandal to all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers.</p>
            <pb n="250" facs="tcp:206808:130"/>
            <p>These Cautions I think needless for those, who look for no other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than what the Sentence of Death is to bring them; the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of their approaching end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficient Security against these mischiefs, without the help of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor. However to these, there is something to be recommended: As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Not to delay their Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Death, till they have heard Sentence Pronounc'd against them: For this cannot be excus'd from Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and many times proves such, as cannot afterwards be recover'd; whilst stricter Confinement, after Condemnation, often cuts off many of those Opportunities and Helps which they had before; and hinders them from making so good a Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as Death requires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Not to permit their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to be seis'd with immoderate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, by reflecting on their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, or the Terrors of Death, For it is very ill Management, to give that time to unprofitable, and it may be, sinful Disquiet, which ought to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:206808:130"/> be employ'd much more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, in preparing their Souls against the last hour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the lessening these Disquiets, and making the best use of their time, that they would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously consider the Mercy, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their present misfortune, which is very great, especially to those, whose Crimes have brought them into these Circumstances. For whereas the lives of these, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally subject to great Disorders, and if this Justice, that has met them, had not put a stop, they might very likely have pursued their evil ways, and as they liv'd, so likewise have died unmindful of God and their Salvation, as is the unhappy Fate of too many; now being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and confin'd, their wicked Course is interrupted, and they have a fair opportunity before them, of Repenting, and making a much better Preparation for another World, than Sickness will generally allow; in which, either through the shortness or sharpness of the Distemper, or the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:206808:131"/> flattering hopes of Recovery, or want of opportunity and necessary helps, wicked Men seldom come to a true Repentance; but as Sickness finds them, so Death generally carries them away. The opportunity therefore of true Conversion is so much greater before a Violent Death, than a Natural, that, notwitstanding the Unhappiness and Terror, it must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be acknowledg'd an effect of a most Providential Mercy; and I don't question, many have come by this way to a true Sense of their Sins and a happy end, who otherwise, would have been surpris'd in their Wickedness, and perish'd everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is a Mercy likewise to all others, since the certain knowledge of Death obliges them to a much stronger and more undisturb'd Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, than is generally practis'd, when the time is not determin'd; that Uncertainty, which God has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd with a design of obliging us to a perpetual watchfulness, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally abus'd and made the occasion of very prejudial neglects, even to the hazarding of our Eternal Lot.</p>
            <pb n="253" facs="tcp:206808:131"/>
            <p>It being thus easie to discover great effects of Mercy, under the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Confinement and Violent Death, it ought to be their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal business; who come into these Circumstances, not to neglect it, but make the best advantange of it they are able, since whatever time they then lose, is irrecoverable Using therefore all possible endeavours to suppress immoderate Solicitude and all manner of Disquiets, they are to consider their present business, and permit nothing to take them off it: For this end they are daily to raise up their Hearts and Hopes to God, and beg him to be their Director, in the Preparation they are to make of appearing before him.</p>
            <p>Before Trial they are every day to commit their Cause into the Hands of God, and endeavour to compose their Minds, for whatever he shall appoint, as knowing all to depend on him, and that Judges and Jury are only to declare, what he has already Decreed: which may be done thus.</p>

               <head>A daily Prayer before Trial.</head>
               <p>O God, in whose Power are all things, and without Order or Permission, nothing happens in this World, I recommend my self and my Cause entirely into thy Hands, beseeching thee to appoint every thing belonging to me, as shall be most conformable to thy Blessed Will. I lay before thee my Desires of meeting a favourable Sentence; but if thou know'st this not to be best for me, do with me as thou pleasest: I am thy Creature, and ought to have no other Will, but thine; and therefore, whatever my Desires are, as to Liberty and Life, I desire now to renounce all these, and lay them down at thy Feet, leaving all to the disposition of thy infinite Wisdom and Goodness, with an assurance of that being best for me, which thou shalt appoint.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:206808:132"/>
               <p>I know, as the Birds of the Air are in thy Care, as there falls not a Leaf from a Tree, or a Hair from my Head, but by thy Providence; so I likewise am a part of thy Care, and that nothing shall befal me, but by thy appointment; in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence I desire to rest, as knowing whatever Powers are over me, they are all subject to thee, and that they cannot move one step in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, but by thy Permission; and therefore, whatever they determine, must be what thou hast Ordain'd for me, they being only the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thy Mercy or Justice.</p>
               <p>Being therefore thus entirely in thy Hands, what have I to doubt, or what to fear? Nothing, O my God, but my self; and therefore mov'd by the Sense of my own weakness, I make my present Address to thee, humbly beseeching thy infinite Goodness to have Compassion on me, to give me that inward strength and steddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind, as to Embrace with true Peace and Submission, whatever thou shalt manifest to be thy Will,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:206808:133"/> and that I may receive the Sentence of my Jury, as if pronounc'd by thy Sacred Mouth, since I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it is thou that speakest, and determin'st my Lot by them. For this end, I beseech thee to direct both my Judge and Jury, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to stand by me, and be my Counsel, to put Words into my Mouth, and help me in my Defence; deliver me from all Solicitude and Surprise, and permit not false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, Prejudice or Passion, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against me. Thus, O my God, I leave my self, both as to Liberty, Life or Death, in thy Hands: I have nothing, but what thou hast given me, and thou may'st take it away when thou pleasest: Do with me, as shall seem good in thy Eyes: Lord, thy Blessed Will be done. Confirm me. I beseech thee, in this Disposition to the end of my Life.</p>
               <p>Preparation being thus daily made for Trial, the rest of the day ought to be employ'd in Prayer and other Holy Exercises for obtaining a true
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:206808:133"/> Conformity to the Will of God, in which <hi>The Christians Daily Exercise</hi> may be a great help, as containing Devotions very proper for this end: But above all, a principal Portion of every day ought to be set a-part for the Prisoner making his Peace with God, by a sincere Repentance and humble Confession of the sins of his whole Life, in which the same Book may be very serviceable, as likewise that short Exercise of Repentance and Contrition set down in these Instructions, p. 124.</p>
               <p>On the day of Trial, he ought in a more particular manner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend his Cause to God, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly importuning him for his Protection and Direction, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down in the Spirit of true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility manifest his Resolutions of Embracing whatever shall appear to be his Holy Will in the Sentence that shall be pass'd upon him.</p>

               <p>O God, thy Will be done. The Lord has given, the Lord takes away; blessed be the name of our Lord. I received my Life from thy hands, and ought not I to surrender it when thou demand'st of me? Now thou hast sent me a Summons, and in this manifested thy Will to me; and as I acknowledge thee to be my Lord, so I know 'tis my duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; I wish I could do it cheerfully and without reluctance; but tho Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be unwilling, yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all unwillingness, behold, I now bow down, and with all possible submission, pronounce from my Heart, <hi>Lord, thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Lord, thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven. Lord, thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</hi>

               <p>And if any thing be wanting in my Heart of that true submission which I here profess with my Lips, pour forth thy Grace upon me, and supply by the power of thy holy Spirit, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Thou know'st all my infirmity, and that of my self I am able to do nothing; but, O God, I believe thy Grace is sufficient for me, and I hope, through thy assistance to do all. Help me, O Jesus, and forsake not this miserable Sinner, who calls upon thee in the day of Distress: Let thy heavenly light shine upon me, and be my Comfort in this day of darkness: Command a calm within my Soul, and let all be there in Peace: Give me Courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that courage which is the Fruit of thy Holy Spirit, that I may bear up against all the Terrors of Death: Give me Patience and true conformity of Will, that I may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all thou hast appointed for me, as becomes a Christian and thy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. Help me, O Jesus, and be to me a Jesus; and permit me not to depart out of this World in thy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</p>

In this penitential and humble way,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:206808:136"/> they ought daily to make their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Heaven, asking for Patience, for Resignation, for Contrition, and for a sincere love of God, and of their Neighbour, and daily exercise their Souls in Acts of these Vertues, in which the <hi>Poor Man</hi>'s <hi>Manuel</hi> may be a great help.

               <p>'Tis time for Dust to return to Dust, and my Spirit to thee, who gav'st it: Open then, Lord, the Gate of Life, and receive me; most Merciful Lord, according to the Multitude of thy tender, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, who receiv'd the Thief on
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:206808:144"/> the Cross, and now prepare my Soul, so hearing the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Mercy, which he did.</p>
               <p>Now, Lord, let thy Servant depart in Peace, according to thy Word. But remember, I am but Dust, and therefore enter not into Judgment with thy poor Servant, for how can I be Justified in thy sight? I confess, I am unworthy to be admitted into thy Presence; all my hope is in thy infinite Goodness and Mercy, which is able to purifie my Soul, and cleanse me from all my Iniquities. In this I hope, and with this Hope I now beg of thee to manifest thy Goodness, and receive my Soul into thy Eternal Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In the Confession of thy Name I desire to breathe out my last: Receive me therefore according to thy great Mercy: Open to me the Gate of Life, and secure me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the Powers of Darkness; let thy Hand conduct me into the place of Refreshment, the place
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:206808:145"/> thou hast prepar'd for those that fear thee.</p>
               <p>Thou know'st, O Lord, my life has abounded in Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; but thou aboundest in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and therefore in the Spirit of Humility and a Contrite Heart, I now beseech thee to receive me, O good Jesu, the Life and Health of my Soul; for 'tis not in the confidence of any Justice of mine, but only of thy Mercies, that I now make my Address to thee.</p>
               <p>I am the lost Sheep, that now returns to my Shepherd, I have heard thy Voice, and desire to follow it: And canst thou now despise the cry of thy poor Sheep, who runs to thee for shelter? Receive him now, I beseech thee into thy Fold. Hast not thou commanded all to come to thee; and promis'd to hear and help those that call upon thee in the day of Tribulatiation?</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:206808:145"/>
               <p>Behold, I call upon thee, Lord; behold Tribulation is upon me, and there's none to help me, none that can Save me, but thou, my good Jesu. Save me, O Jesus, in this hour.</p>
               <p>Christ Jesus, who wast Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for our Redemption, I beseech thee, by that Love, which brought thee from Heaven, to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on me: Forgive me all my Sins, and by the Merits of thy bitter Passion satisfie for all my Failings, and supply all my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Dispose now my Soul, that it may be prepar'd to go forth to meet thee. Grant true Patience and perfect Resignation in my last Anguish; Confirm my Faith, Strengthen me in Hope, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect me in Charity, that departing hence, my Soul may be receiv'd into thy Mercy.</p>
               <p>O dear Redeemer, by that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, which thou sufier'dst on the Cross, when thou criedst out to thy
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:206808:146"/> Eternal Father, I beseech thee to have mercy on me in my extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and at the time, when I cannot speak for my self, speak thou for me, who art the Eternal Word, and to whom the Father will refuse nothing.</p>
               <p>O God, be merciful to me a Sinner: O God, be merciful to me a Sinner. Lord Jesus, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit: Lord Jesus, receive my Soul.</p>
